# Temporun - nFactorial AI Cup 2025

## 🏃‍♂️ Project Overview

**Temporun** is a cutting-edge multimodal AI agent designed for runners, combining computer vision, biomechanics analysis, and personalized coaching to optimize running performance and shoe selection.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Runners often struggle with:
- Poor running posture leading to injuries
- Choosing inappropriate footwear for their biomechanics
- Lack of personalized coaching guidance
- Limited access to professional gait analysis

**Target Audience**: B2C - Recreational and competitive runners seeking performance optimization and injury prevention.

## 🔬 Multimodal AI Architecture

### Modalities Implemented:
1. **Computer Vision (Image)**: 
   - Side-profile posture analysis
   - Top-down foot structure assessment
   - Real-time biomechanics evaluation

2. **Natural Language Processing (Text)**:
   - Conversational AI coaching
   - Personalized shoe recommendations
   - Training advice and injury prevention tips

3. **Data Analytics**:
   - Foot type classification
   - Gait pattern recognition
   - Performance metrics tracking
